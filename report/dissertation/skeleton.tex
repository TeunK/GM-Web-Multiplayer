\chapter{Introduction}
%intro and synopsis (topic description and setting context of published literature, main results summarized.. about 5 pages)
%- summary of ALL contributions, code, research interpretations, tests, experiments (bulleted list)
In the current day and age, we spend a large portion of our time using web applications. A vast amount of the internet consists of services supported by web applications, and browser games are as popular as ever.

There exist many good reasons for this. Browser applications and games do not require prior installation. They are therefore easy to start up, safe from viruses and don't require an admin-user account in order to be executed\cite{Web_Apps_Superior}. They are able to interact with other web applications. They are highly platform independent and potential users are generally easy to reach. Also their updates are seamless and can be implemented without requiring patch downloads to a harddrive.

The market in this area is therefore booming. Developers all across the world are trying to be the fastest at developing their games, in the easiest way possible. The easier the process, the faster the development. The faster the development, the sooner the game can be released.

One of many developer tools that aims for exactly these two ideals is GameMaker Studio. However due to the feature limitation of creating networked applications, developers may be forced to use less suited software instead. 

This paper therefore investigates the quality of related software. It also demonstrates how an extension can be added to GameMaker, one that will add networking features to HTML5 games and applications. Additionally, the server's behaviour will be assessed based on the specified setup, and suggestions will be added based on other literature in order to improve this further.

\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\section{Background}
\subsection{Networks in Applications}
%include minimal requirements
%which criteria to consider when testing a network
Humans are naturally social beings, are found to be more drawn into games when this social aspect is being provided, and are therefore more likely to return in the future\cite{Browser_Games}. When allowed, we can share a sense of community, develop our own social identity within the application, and regularly seek social support from peer users, even about non-related and real-life topics\cite{Community_Social_Psychology}. Users of networked applications are \textbf{more likely to advertise} the application in their social circles than they are for non-networked applications.

\subsection{Network Fairness}
Having that said, one must consider the technical aspect of the network: if the application is in the form of a game, \textbf{playability and fairness are crucial for an enjoyable gameplay}. This is especially true for games containing elements where speed or response time is important. \textit{TODO: Add reference}
%TODO add reference

In a typical networked game, game clients are described by a \textbf{limited set of parameters} received by a server. These parameters represent the "game state". \textbf{When due to delay between the clients and server the game state is desynchronised, fairness is reduced}\cite{Fairness_and_Playability}.

\subsection{TCP versus UDP}
%TODO explain what is tcp and udp before mentioning which one is better when. because.. what do they do??
\textit{TODO: explain what is tcp and udp before mentioning which one is better when. because.. what are they? what do they do?}

Choosing the right protocol to handle the data transmissions is therefore crucial. Transmission protocols are one of the contributors that will heavily characterise the network.
 
Generally speaking, TCP is a form of reliable data transmission but contains therefore extra overhead, making it therefore known to be slightly slower than UDP when the network has little packet loss.

\subsubsection{Socket.io}
Socket.io is an event-driven JavaScript library that can be used both on the client's browser, and a server\cite{Socketio}. It supports features that allow sending and receiving data using the WebSocket protocol built in 2011 (which is handled through TCP), without interruption of the code flow\cite{Socketio_Benchmark}\cite{Socketio_TCP_Benchmark}. For this reason, it is \textbf{often used in combination with Node.js}.

\subsubsection{WebRTC}
As aforementioned, Websocket is a protocol built on TCP. However, it has a little sister: WebRTC. WebRTC built on UDP, but is still vaguely "under construction"\cite{Browser_Networking}. Although certain web applications have already been created with WebRTC (mainly for P2P video streaming \cite{P2P_Video_Streaming_HTML5_WebRTC}), no proper standards are out yet\cite{Web_Apps_Superior}.

This, combined with requirement of manually specifying the rules of communication, as well as the fact that WebRTC has to circumvent network security and privacy in order to allow web browsers to transmit data over UDP\cite{P2P_Video_Streaming_HTML5_WebRTC}, makes UDP many times \textbf{more complicated} for developers to handle efficiently.

\subsection{HTML5}
\paragraph{}HTML5 is a raising web standard released in 2014 by the W3C. It is designed to be \textbf{cross-platform} and runs on most modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Opera \footnote{HTML5 supported browsers are found at \url{https://html5test.com/results/desktop.html}}. Also mobile web browsers that come preinstalled on iPhones, iPads and Android phones support HTML5.

It superseeds its predecessors HTML4 and XHTML1.1 with the aim to reduce the dependence of functionality from third-party plugins such as Flash and Java applets, which are either deprecated or entirely unsupported by most devices \cite{Death_Flash_Java}.

Scripting is replaced in HTML5 by markup where possible, causing the world of browser-gaming to change rapidly. One of the the newly introduced features is the <canvas> element, which is defined as "a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics or other visual images on the fly"\cite{HTML5_Up_and_Running}. \textbf{The element can thus be used to draw graphics in JavaScript with the "Canvas API"}\cite{Canvas_API}.

\subsection{Node.js}
%include socket.io %benchmarks for socket.io made by other developers
Traditionally, servers create a separate thread for each client, therefore rapidly running out of RAM and keeping clients on hold until memory for a new thread is released\cite{Why_Nodejs}.

Node.js is a JavaScript interface with the aim to create "real-time websites with push capability" allowing developers to work in the "non-blocking event-driven I/O paradigm" \cite{Why_Nodejs}. This means that developers can use it to create real-time web applications where a server and client can both initiate communication, and that both can exchange data freely without repeatedly having to refresh the webpage.

In short, new client connections get allocated to a heap in the memory and client events are handled on a single thread by the server's operating system without choking the (Node.js) event loop. \textbf{This therefore allows servers running Node.js to maintain thousands of concurrent connections without running out of RAM memory}\cite{Node_Stress_Test}\cite{NodeJS_Image}, as opposed to the traditional, less scalable servers.


\subsection{GameMaker}
%include its evolution and typical target audience
%explain the types of target audience, who do the developers of an application using the extension intend to target. How does this affect the demands on the network
%focus on location of users
GameMaker by YoYoGames is a software creation tool with the aim to simplify and speed up game and app development. There have been several hits on the market for games developed with Gamemaker such as "Reflections", "Rick O'Shea" and "Simply Solitaire" \cite{Gamemaker_DnD}.

Developing applications and games in GameMaker is cheap, simple to learn and flexible to use, making the software demanded by small teams, professionals and novice developers \cite{Mark_Overmars}. Sandy Duncan, the founder and former chief executive officer of YoYoGames stated in a phone interview that they have never lost money on a game that they developed with their technology\cite{Gamemaker_DnD}.

During the rise of HTML5 and the growing popularity of Gamemaker, YoyoGames has provided the functionality to export any application to a JavaScript program that can be executed directly in the browser\cite{GameMaker_Studio}.

Some of the features are normally supported by GameMaker are however lost during the transition to a web application. One of these features is the networking functionality. Thus far since the update to export GameMaker applications to HTML5 in September 2011, YoYoGames has never included this feature\footnote{http://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002\_reference/networking/index.html}. Several attempts have been made by the YoYoGames community, however all known versions are considered to be in alpha stage and are regularly found to fail to be used by other developers\footnote{https://github.com/amorri40/39js}. %TODO stronger argument WHY it doesnt work

The main GameMaker community forum is hosted directly by YoYoGames\footnote{http://gmc.yoyogames.com/}, serving 280.000 registered users recorded in January 2016, with a combined total of 220.000 topics and 3.480.000 posts. There also exists a notable GameMaker forum in the Netherlands\footnote{http://www.game-maker.nl/forums/} which hosts an additional 557.000 posts for 56.000 topics for almost 18.000 members.

\section{Related Work}
Being a cross-platform game development tool primarily for 2D graphically oriented games, GameMaker has many competitors. It is therefore sensible for developers to first consider using game developing tools that support networking features natively. Although, looking for "the best" development tool is unreasonable, as this is a matter of personal preference. Before being able to investigate pros and cons between gamemaker and related game development tools, appropriate competitors must first be identified.

Note that GameMaker does natively support networking functionality for non-browser games. However we must remind ourselves of the aim of this project: creating a networking extension to improve GameMaker's functionality \textbf{for developing 2D browser games}. For this reason, this paper will consider GameMaker to be a development tool for browser games.

In order to find the most related software for these purposes, assistance was found from online third-party instances. These instances collect user feedback for the browser-game development tools. Their ratings were established by allowing users to criticise tools based on their personal experience, and apply a score. The review system of html5gameengine.com\footnote{https://html5gameengine.com/} represents that of the Google Play Store\cite{Google_Play_Store} and the Apple App Store\cite{Apple_App_Store}, and may therefore be a somewhat reasonable method for finding the more commonly used tools.

developer.mozilla.org\footnote{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tools/Engines\_and\_tools} (world rank 198 by alexa.com\footnote{http://www.alexa.com/}) hosts a list of tools titled "HTML5 game engines", and holds suggestions by 26 developers each with different backgrounds in 2D browser game development. gamepix.com\footnote{http://www.gamepix.com/blog/the-big-list-of-2d-html5-games-engines/} hosts a list of similar tools, but is less detailed about their sources.

The following table of related software is carefully constructed by combining the best rated 2D browser-supported game developing tools as advertised by the communities for the instances mentioned above.

\subsection{Pixi.js, EaselJS, Quintus and Crafty.js}
Despite Pixi.js, EaselJS, Crafty.js and Quintus being tools for developing 2D browser games, they are merely JavaScript frameworks and libraries to assist developers when creating raw JavaScript games. If networking is expected to be part of a browser game, these tools will also require additional resources for implementing this feature.

Their community is relatively small and scattered across the web. The forums for these tools are hosted on third-party websites and make it therefore difficult to measure their size and activity accurately.

%explain every detail of how the experiments were setup, how everything worked.
%Note: add reminder that developers can setup peer-to-peer network by using the extension to serve as both server and client in their client application, but that these tests specifically consider the strength of each individual application acting as server.

\subsection{Controlled Network Experiments}
The controlled experiments were conducted in order to predict server behaviour when loaded under similar pressure in future occasions. 

\subsubsection{Concurrent Connections Specifics}
\paragraph{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variable number of concurrent connections cc, up to 15 instances with each simulating at most 500 clients.
\item Clients do not contact the server after establishing a connection.
\item The CPU usage, time and RSS (Resident set size) are recorded after each every time another group of 100 clients connect to the server.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Dependent variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item CPU usage on the server
\item CPU time on the server
\item RSS on the server
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Message Broadcasting Specifics}
\paragraph{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item 5000 concurrent connections (10 instances each simulating at most 500 clients).
\item Each package that is sent has a size of 8 bytes.
\item Each client sends packages at regular time intervals, causing the server to handle n messages every second.
\item Each client measures the roundtrip time of its package to the server.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Dependent variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean roundtrip time between all clients
\item Variance of the roundtrip time between all clients
\item Standard Deviation of the roundtrip time between all clients
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Server hardware and network specification}
\paragraph{}The controlled network experiments were executed on a Windows 7 64-bit platform with 12.6GB available physical memory and an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz processor. The software included Node v0.12.3 and Socket.io v1.3.7 in order to handle the networking operations.

The network was controlled using Dummynet, using a below-average UK household network setup. This involves an upload speed of 5Mbit/s, and a download speed of 1Mbit/, although no packet loss was set in order to ensure consistency throughout the controlled network experiments.

\subsection{Real Network Experiments}
The network was consistently running with a 54.0Mb/s download and 3.0Mb/s upload speed.
\paragraph{}Multiple tests were executed with clients being located at specified locations. In each case, the clients were sending 8-byte messages to the server at a regular interval of 1 second for 2 minutes. The 120 roundtrip times for each client were then averaged in order to blur occasional peaks. At this point the roundtrip times of the clients in each common location were averaged, and then the deviance of the roundtrip times at each of these locations were calculated.

All network experiments were executed using a single server located in Edinburgh and in each experiment all clients were connected and communicating to that server simultaneously.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Controlled Network Results}
\subsubsection{Concurrent Connections}
The following experiment evaluates the server performance with regard to the number of clients.

When the CPU usage is above 70 percent, the user may experience lag. Such high CPU usage indicates insufficient processing power. Either the CPU needs to be upgraded, or the user experience reduced.

\subsection{Real Network Results}
\subsubsection{Location-wise Delay Fairness}
The following experiment evaluates the effect of the geographical distance between groups of clients and the server with respect to fairness in response-time from the server to the clients.

\paragraph{Test cases:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Local network setting: Five clients physically located in the same local home network.

\item Same city: Five clients physically located in Edinburgh (LAN excluded).

\item Same country: Three clients physically located in Scotland: Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee.

\item Europe: Five clients physically located in the United Kingdom, Hungary, France, Germany and the Netherlands.

\item Inter-continental: Eight clients physically located in South Africa, California (USA), India, Thailand, Germany, Hungary, United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

\end{enumerate}
